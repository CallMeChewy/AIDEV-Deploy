# Project AIDEV-Deploy: Session Continuity Document

**Created: March 21, 2025 5:45 PM**

## Current Session Overview

In this session, we've been working on the AIDEV-Deploy project, which is a file deployment system with validation, backup, and rollback capabilities. We've successfully created the core components of the application following the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 standard. The project has been initialized on GitHub under the account CallMeChewy.

## Completed Components

1. **Core Components**

   - **DatabaseManager.py**: Manages SQLite database operations including schema creation and queries
   - **TransactionManager.py**: Handles atomic transactions for deployment operations
   - **ValidationEngine.py**: Validates files against AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 standard
   - **BackupManager.py**: Manages project backups with verification and restoration
   - **DeploymentEngine.py**: Coordinates deployment process with validation and backup
2. **Utility Components**

   - **ConfigManager.py**: Manages application configuration with type validation
   - **LoggingManager.py**: Provides centralized logging functionality
3. **Application Entry Point**

   - **Main.py**: CLI interface to interact with all components
4. **Testing**

   - **TestValidation.py**: Basic tests for the ValidationEngine
5. **Documentation**

   - **README.md**: Project overview and usage instructions

## Current Status

The project has a functioning command-line interface with the following capabilities:

- File validation against AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 standards
- Transaction-based deployment of files
- Project backup and restoration
- Configuration management

The GUI component is planned but not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

### 1. GUI Implementation

Create the GUI interface using PySide6:

1. **MainWindow.py**: Main application window

   - Layout with file browser, validation panel, and deployment controls
   - Integration with all core components
2. **FileBrowser.py**: File selection and navigation

   - Tree view for directory navigation
   - File filtering and selection capabilities
3. **DiffViewer.py**: Visual comparison of files

   - Side-by-side diff view
   - Syntax highlighting
4. **ValidationPanel.py**: Validation results display

   - Error and warning list with navigation to issues
   - Integration with ValidationEngine

### 2. Ollama Integration

Implement Ollama integration for AI-assisted validation:

1. **OllamaClient.py**: Client for interacting with Ollama API

   - Model selection and API communication
   - Validation assistance and error correction suggestions
2. **ValidationAssistant.py**: AI-powered validation helper

   - Pattern recognition for common errors
   - Automated fix suggestions

### 3. Multi-User Support

Implement proper multi-user capabilities:

1. **UserManager.py**: User and permission management

   - User authentication
   - Role-based access control
2. **ConcurrencyManager.py**: Handling concurrent operations

   - File locking
   - Conflict resolution

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

Expand the test suite:

1. Add unit tests for all components
2. Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
3. Add UI tests when GUI is implemented

## Technical Considerations

1. **Database Structure**: All core tables have been created with proper relationships
2. **Transaction Handling**: Atomic operations with proper rollback are implemented
3. **Standards Compliance**: Validation against AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 is functioning
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging is in place
5. **Configuration**: Centralized configuration with environment variable overrides is implemented

## Dependencies

The project requires:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PySide6 (for GUI, not yet implemented)
- SQLite (included with Python)
- PyYAML, loguru, and other dependencies listed in Requirements.txt

## Notes for Continuation

1. Start by implementing the GUI components if full functionality is needed, or focus on enhancing CLI functionality if GUI is not a priority
2. Follow the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 standard for all new code
3. Ensure proper testing is added for any new components
4. Update documentation as features are implemented
