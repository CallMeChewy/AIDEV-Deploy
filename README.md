**Created: March 21, 2025 3:45 PM**

## 1. Project Overview

AIDEV-Deploy is a secure, GUI-based transaction management system for automating file deployment within project folders with comprehensive validation, backup, and rollback capabilities. It integrates with the ProjectHimalaya ecosystem to ensure consistent application of development standards across projects.

### 1.1 Core Features

- **Transaction-Based Deployment**: Atomic operations with rollback capabilities
- **Standards Validation**: Automated validation against AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6
- **Visual Diff**: Side-by-side comparison of source and destination files
- **Automatic Backups**: Pre-deployment project backups
- **Ollama Integration**: AI-assisted validation and error correction
- **Multi-User Support**: Role-based permissions and concurrent operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed action tracking and reporting

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

- **TransactionManager**: Ensures atomic file operations
- **ValidationEngine**: Validates files against project standards
- **BackupManager**: Handles project backups and restoration
- **DeploymentEngine**: Manages file deployment operations
- **OllamaClient**: Integrates with Ollama for AI assistance
- **DatabaseManager**: Manages persistent storage of operations

### 2.2 User Interface Components

- **MainWindow**: Primary application interface
- **FileBrowser**: File selection and navigation
- **DiffViewer**: Visual comparison of files
